          <p class="py-2 leading-relaxed">
            Known for throwing unforgettable raves and electrifying live music events, GlitchWitch.fm has recently stepped behind the decks as a DJ. Learning directly from legendary humans such as LSDave, Pigeon, Nibs, Upcycle Sounds, and Ali Khan, they played their debut set at December 2025's Apothecary Afters at SkullSpace. Always working to bring their infectious energy and a meticulously curated setlist to the dance floor, Jade is available to DJ events — book via Instagram or email!

            As part of the Woodland Creatures Flow Troupe, Jade explores the art of flow and movement. Beyond performance, they support the group as lead videographer and coordinator, helping the troupe shine both on and off stage.

            In summer 2025, Jade founded "The Attic": a DIY house venue devoted to queer and anti-capitalist values, hosting live shows and nurturing community connection in Winnipeg. Local and traveling artists alike have found a creative haven here.

            Since spring 2025, Jade has immersed themselves in Winnipeg's local hackerspace, SkullSpace, leading major initiatives and fostering a welcoming environment for both newcomers and veteran makers. Their impacts can be felt across the space, from the improved DJ booth, to the complete reorganization of the space, and the revamped energy and structure around hosting fun, safe, and creative events that bring the community together while helping the space thrive.

            Always working to expand their talents, Jade began learning drums at the We Rock Winnipeg Adult Rock Camp in 2019, and continues to practice on a regular basis. One day they may pick up the sticks and join a band.

            <br>
            While Jade had used the "<a class="hover:underline text-cyan-400" href="https://glitchwitch.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GlitchWitch.io</a>" pseudonym since 2017 as their hacker handle, including giving talks at the Winnipeg Security b-sides as early as 2018 and starting a company based on this naming in 2022, this seemingly did not prevent namespace collisions from occuring in their own city. In late 2024 another "Glitch Witch" entered the scene in Winnipeg, rebranding from her previous VJ name "D_NYCE" she had used across 2023-2024 and creating some level of confusion. In early 2025 the two crossed paths at an event and a glitch in the matrix was revealed. Perhaps one day there will be a glitchwitch² event colab? In the meantime, treat this incantation as an explination and abreviated history. glitchwitch.fm ≠ theglitchwitch_204.
