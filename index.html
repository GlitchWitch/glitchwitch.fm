        <h1 class="font-medium text-4xl border-b border-dotted mb-4 pt-8 pb-2">SkullSpace</h1>
        <p class="py-2">
          As of spring 2025, Jade became an active member of their local hackerspace, SkullSpace. In their first year they have taken on several large initiaves in the space including but not limited to; Reorganization and improvement of the space and specifically the lounge, workshop, and DJ booth. Helping and initiating anti-social and nuit blanche style late night events, spearheading the after hours, and some occasional respectful challenging of authority.

          ERROR: namespace collision detected - initiating verbose crash dump...
          <br>
          While Jade had used the "<a class="hover:underline text-cyan-600" href="https://glitchwitch.io/">GlitchWitch.io</a>" pseudonym since 2017 as their hacker handle, including giving talks at the Winnipeg Security b-sides as early as 2018 and starting a company based on this naming in 2022, another "Glitch Witch" entered the scene in 2022 as a VJ. In 2025 the two crossed paths and a glitch in the matrix was revealed. Perhaps one day there will be a glitchwitch² event colab? In the meantime, treat this incantation as an explination. <span class="font-mono">glitchwitch.fm ≠ theglitchwitch_204 </span>
